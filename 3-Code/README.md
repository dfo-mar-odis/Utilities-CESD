This folder contains scripts pulled from the COERS section's Old Sow legacy server. files contained in the CTD/DRIFTER/ADCP folders are the historical scripts written by Randy Losier, who is now retired. The scripts were written over many years and are very specific to each unit's specific data format.

Data is also uploaded directly from the scripts to the *losierr.XXX* tables on PTRAN.
