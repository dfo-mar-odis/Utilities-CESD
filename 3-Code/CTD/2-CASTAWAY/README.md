CTD Legacy scripts
==================
Scripts in this folder were pulled from the COERS legacy Old sow server in February 2018. All scripts were written by Randy Losier who is now retired from DFO.

* **castaway.f**: processing script for Castaway CTD meter
* **RScript_CASTAWAY_QC_v10.R**: Fred Page's QC script for new Castaway CTD data. ~4300 lines of code, needs to be cleaned up and streamlined.
